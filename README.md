# Tank-Game
In this game, you'll control a tank right in the middle of a meteor shower on the moon. Survive by shooting the incoming meteors and maybe you'll make it back to earth.

This game is more complex, bigger and ambitious than my previous game, "The Snake Game". I'm not promising anything, but there might be:

- Powerups for your tank 
- Actual sound effects and music
- Various weapons to shoot the meteors with

I'm not sure when I'll be finished, but I'd say I'm around 40% done.
